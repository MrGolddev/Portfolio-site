# cortex.rest Analysis

## Layout & Design Inspiration:
- **Clean & Modern:** Overall aesthetic is clean, using dark themes with distinct sections.
- **Header:** Contains logo/name, navigation links (Home, About, Commissions), potentially social links/icons, and status indicators (weather/time?). Uses colored outlines/highlights for active/hover states.
- **Hero Section:** Prominent heading, subheading, social/contact icons, possibly an embedded media player (music?). Uses rounded rectangle containers with subtle background patterns/gradients.
- **Sections:** Clearly defined sections like "Technologies", "About Me", "Commissions", "Projects". Uses cards for individual items (e.g., technology tags, project summaries).
- **Technology Display:** Uses styled tags/badges with icons for listing technologies.
- **Project Display:** Uses cards with project logo/icon, name, star count (GitHub?), description, technology tags, and potentially links.
- **Footer:** Minimal, contains copyright information and potentially technology stack used (e.g., "Made with NextJS & TailwindCSS").
- **Background:** Uses a subtle, dark, possibly topographic or abstract pattern.
- **Theme:** Dark theme, uses bright accent colors (like the blues, purples, oranges seen in screenshots) for highlights, links, and icons. Seems to incorporate glossy/glassmorphism elements subtly.

## Structure:
- Single-page layout, navigated via header links or scrolling.
- Content organized into logical sections.

## Key Elements to Replicate:
- Overall dark, clean layout.
- Section structure (Hero, About, Experience/Projects, Technologies, Contact/Footer).
- Card-based design for content blocks (About, Experience, Projects).
- Styled technology tags/badges.
- Minimal footer.
- Use of accent colors (will adapt to dark green/blue as requested).
- Rounded corners and container styles.
